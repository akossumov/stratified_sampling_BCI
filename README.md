# Stratified Sampling Analysis on BCI Soil Data

This is a small project I carried out using spatial data from **Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama**.
The goal was to investigate the effect of **stratified simple random sampling without replacement** on the estimation of the population mean of **calcium (Ca) content** in soil.

## Project Overview
Using a complete 1000 Ã— 500 meter grid dataset of mineral concentrations, I compared:
- **Cum-root-f stratification** (based on the covariate iron, Fe)
- **Geographical stratification**
- **Simple random sampling without replacement**

For the stratified designs, proportional allocation was applied.

A simulation study was performed to estimate:
- Population mean
- Sampling variance
- Design effect
for various sample sizes (**n**) and numbers of strata (**H**).

## Data
The dataset contains full mineral concentration measurements with no missing pixels.

**Note:** The dataset is not publicly available.
If you would like access to the data, feel free to contact me.

## Notes
This is a small academic project demonstrating stratified sampling concepts on real spatial data.
